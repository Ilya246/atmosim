# Usage instructions

## Getting a ready release

1. Go to the releases tab (.../atmosim/releases)
2. Get the latest release depending on your system

## Compiling it yourself (will run faster)

Just make sure you have git and a C++ compiler ready, `git submodule init`, `git submodule update`, then run build.bat or build_linux.sh depending on your OS<br>
A proper makefile is currently TODO

## Running

1. Open a console (on Windows press win+r then type in `cmd`), then `cd .../path/to/atmosim`, path/to/atmosim being its location on your disk
2. Run `atmosim -h` or `atmosim.exe -h`
